## Introduction

This project is to create a landing page for the company "Blooming Foods" which is a start-up for crisps made from Lupin Flowers.

## Objectives

1) Create a simple landing page with a short description of the company and founder.
2) Include links to articles about the company.
3) Allow clients to submit their email address to receive a newsletter.

## Planning

I had a meeting with Charlotte to discuss the objectives of the project, the timescale and design ideas.

Based on the design given, I decided i should be able to implement a simple 1 page website without the need for any css frameworks.
