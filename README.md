# blooming_foods
## Introduction

This project is to create a landing page for the company "Blooming Foods" which is a start-up for crisps made from Lupin Flowers.

## Objectives

1) Create a simple landing page with a short description of the company and founder.
2) Allow clients to submit their email address to receive a newsletter.
3) Use 1 page with scrollable panels for each section.

## Planning

I had a meeting with Charlotte to discuss the objectives of the project, the timescale and initial design ideas.

As the branding had not been finalised at this stage I was able to be more creative with the design ideas and put into practice my knowledge about web design as well as the development aspect whilst staying within Charlottes vision.

TBC planning still in progress!
