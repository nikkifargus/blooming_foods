# blooming_foods
## Introduction

This project is to create a landing page for the company "Blooming Foods" which is a start-up for crisps made from Lupin Flowers.

## Objectives

1) Create a simple landing page with a short description of the company and founder.
2) Include links to articles about the company.
3) Allow clients to submit their email address to receive a newsletter.
4) Use 1 page with scrollable panels for each section.

Based on this I decided to create a parallax website

## Planning

I had a meeting with Charlotte to discuss the objectives of the project, the timescale and initial design ideas.

As the branding had not been finalised at this stage I was able to be more creative with the design ideas and put into practice my knowledge about web design as well as the development aspect whilst staying within Charlottes vision.

I then researched how to implement a sleek parallax design. Then based the wire framing on this.

TBC planning still in progress!
